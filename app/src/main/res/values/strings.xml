In order to lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than your BMR is at. More exercise will increase the number of calories you burn, but make sure that a good diet is your main plan of action for weight loss. We can offer you some tips below. \n \n
- Eat fewer calorie-dense foods; this will help you reduce cravings. \n
- Eating more filling foods such as vegetables or proteins, as these foods will make you feel full longer and not give in to temptations to snack. \n
- Remember to eat something you like, as it is important you stick to a diet you will not be discouraged by. With the right nutrients and preparation, you can still eat your favorite dishes! \n \n
Remember to read the food labels and prepare food accordingly, and keep in mind that 1 kilogram of body fat is around 7700 calories. Always make sure you stay within the daily recommended amounts of nutrients such as salt, fat, calcium, vitamins, or sugar, and make sure your plan accommodates your liking.</string>
